            <p>
                By now, most folks in the Petz community have a good sense of what works
                — and what doesn't — when it comes to Petz breeding, especially those who've
                been breeding since the late '90s. But for new and returning players, breeding
                still proves to be a confusing and often frustrating experience. To this day,
                even Petz veterans might find themselves scratching their heads when faced 
                with a stubborn pair of parents throwing suspiciously colored offspring.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately, the vibrant Petz community has pooled together their findings
                and experiences over the years, shedding some much-needed light on the mystery that's
                Petz genetics. Unfortunately, many of these community members have moved on,
                leaving both the community and their research behind. And with the release
                of new applications and reverse-engineering tools, such as Reflet's GenePoolz,
                some of these community-standard guides might possibly be considered out-of-date in 2018.
            </p>
            <p>
                Armed with time-loved Petz breeding guides of the past and modern tools of the present,
                I decided to see if I could piece together a puzzle that still seemed a bit foggy and unclear.
                And after working on both a selective breeding project and a purebred-noninbred Dalmatian breeding project,
                both with fantastic, not to mention fast, results, I thought others in the community might be
                interested in reading about my experiences and applying what I've learned to their own projects.

            <strong>Gene Basics</strong>
        </div>

        <div class="long-form">
            <p>
                According to GenePoolz, petz carry two sets of genes: eighteen dominant genes and eighteen recessive genes, 
                for a grand total of thirty-six genes making up their complete genetic profile.
            </p>
            <p>
                When breeding two parents from the adoption center, a mutation may occur. 
                The phrase “genetic mutation” is often used to describe all breeding mutations, 
                mutations being unexpected changes in petz offspring. However, a mutation is not 
                always guaranteed to be a genetic mutation. In fact, the physical appearance of 
                offspring may exhibit a mutation without the offspring carrying the gene in their 
                genetic profile whatsoever. And if a gene is not present in their dominant or 
                recessive gene pools, one or both, the mutation cannot be passed down, ever. 
                Any instances of the gene or exhibited feature appearing to pass down in such 
                a case would in fact be classified as a mutation itself and should not be 
                mistaken as genetics naturally passing down.   
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving forward from here, it’s helpful to imagine petz have two inheritable sets of genes, 
                dominant genes and recessive genes. Based on personal experience, dominant and recessive 
                genes have less to do with genetic profiles of offspring and more to do with their 
                physical appearance. Meaning, parents’ dominant genes are more likely to translate 
                into the exhibited features of offspring than recessive genes. And when two parents 
                share a recessive gene, their offspring has a much higher chance to exhibit that 
                feature than if only one parent carried it.
            </p>
            <p>
                When genes are passed down from parents to offspring, their genetic profile could map 
                to that of their parents, but often the gene values shuffle. This means that dominant 
                genes can become recessive, and recessive genes can become dominant. Likewise, marking 
                factor values can shuffle from the first position to the second position, and the second 
                position to the first position. Therefore, it’s important to ensure parents share desired 
                genes before breeding to minimize the effects of gene shuffling. That said, unlike genetic 
                mapping and shuffling, genetic mutations are random and cannot be prevented or mitigated. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, it’s helpful to imagine petz have one set of uninheritable, exhibited features, 
                which could be described as their visible appearance. In offspring, exhibited features 
                are normally derived from the genetic profiles of parents—never from the offspring’s own 
                genetic profile—but they have the potential to mutate, just as genes do.
            </p>
            <p>
                In later stages of breeding projects, parents often carry desired genes in both their 
                dominant and recessive gene pools, which directly affects the likelihood of offspring 
                exhibiting those desired features. Usually the success of a breeding project is measured 
                by how closely offspring resemble the genetic profile they carry, at which point they 
                “breed true,” or as according to the standard of the breeder.
            </p>
            <p>
                If absolutely nothing else is taken away from this guide, remember that 
                <span class="highlight-in-text">petz genetics indicate only what their children will look like</span>, and 
                <span class="highlight-in-text">any shared characteristics between a petz and their own genetics are entirely coincidental</span>. 
                This is the key to demystifying petz genetics. It’s not random.

            <strong>GenePoolz Bug Report</strong>
        </div>

        <div class="long-form">
            <p>
                The read-me file packaged with GenePoolz reports a possible Petz bug, suggesting that petz may “have” 
                pink (color chart 75) or black (color chart 244) eye color mutations, which, from my understanding, 
                are visibly exhibited but not present in their genetic profile. 
            </p>
            <p>
                However, based on my personal experience breeding and using GenePoolz, I believe this is in fact a 
                feature of Petz, not a bug. As detailed in the section above and throughout the rest of this 
                guide, a petz’ exhibited features may not always reflect their genetic profiles. I argue, and will 
                hopefully demonstrate, this is not limited only to pink or black eyes, but to any and all possible 
                mutations.

            <strong>Marking Factor</strong>
        </div>

        <div class="long-form">
            <p>
                Each genetic profile contains two pairs of marking factor genes, two dominant and two recessive, determining the probability of 
                offspring exhibiting inherited markings and the likely abundancy of these markings.
                Petz only have room in their genetic profile to carry two groups of markings.

            <div class="guide-image">

            <p>
                Adoption center parents will always carry marking factor values of 100 (out of 100) in all four gene categories.
                However, by genetic mutation, second-generation offspring may carry marking factor values anywhere from 0 to 100.
                Like all mutations, marking factor is not guaranteed to be simultaneously exhibited and carried in offspring's genetic profile.
            </p>
            <div class="guide-image">
                <img alt="" title="This Dalmatian carries a value of 0." src="../img/guide-01-genes-mf-2.png">
            </div>
            
            <p>
                When breeding, it's possible for offspring to inherit marking factor genes identical to those of the parent, both in value and position.
                Meaning, if a parent's dominant "Marking 1 Factor" contains a value of 50, their offspring may then inherit a dominant "Marking 1 Factor" value of 50.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, when offspring inherits a parent’s marking factor genes, neither the value nor the position are guaranteed. 
                Meaning, the marking factor value may jump from “Marking 1 Factor” to “Marking 2 Factor” in offspring. Further, the 
                marking factor value may also jump from dominant to recessive and vice versa. Lastly, a mutated marking factor value 
                may map to the same position, but the value itself may mutate into a new number. 
            </p>
            <div class="guide-image">
                <img alt="" title="The value of 0 has jumped to a new position." src="../img/guide-01-genes-mf-3.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                Based on personal experience, marking factor values from 0 to 99 may be more likely to mutate than those at 100, 
                but this is just superstition and could very likely be coincidental mutations. Further, it may also be possible 
                for marking factor values to duplicate and appear more than once in the genetic profiles of offspring. For example, 
                one of my petz carries a marking factor value of 0, but one of their offspring was born with two marking factor 
                values of 0. While this, too, may very well have been a coincidental mutation, I find it a highly improbably one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, offspring exhibiting low or high marking factor is not a reliable indication they're carriers of inheritable genes.
                For example, offspring which appear to have no markings may produce offspring with many markings. Likewise, offspring which
                appear to have many markings may produce offspring with no markings. 
                Again, the source of truth is the genetic profile.
            </p>
            <p>
                While breeding, take note of which markings are influence by either the “Marking 1 Factor” or “Marking 2 Factor” genes. 
                It’s also important not to dismiss offspring entirely if an ideal marking factor value maps to a less-than-ideal position. 
                With diligent breeding, the gene can be salvaged by the right genetic shuffle.

                All petz carry two sets of coat color genes, five dominant and five recessive.

                When the colors of body parts match, they are described as “selfie.” 
                “Selfie” body parts may include selfie ears, selfie eyelids, selfie eyes, selfie

                Normally, to be considered “selfie,” only the color itself must match, not 
                necessarily the shade (or color chart number). For instance, any shade of 
                dusty eyelids would be considered “selfie” to a dusty coat. However,
                the closer the shade is to the coat color, the more effective the look.

            <p>
                It's important to note that cream and steel coats can’t have “selfie” 
                eyelids because eyelids do not mutate into cream or steel colors. The 
                agreed-upon community standard for “selfie” cream coats are dusty, 
                sometimes white, eyelids, and for steel coats, gray eyelids.

                adoption center, the mother’s body-part genes will be dominant, and 
                the father’s body-part genes will be recessive. Most important, the 
                parents’ body-part genes will never be shuffled in second-generation 
                offspring. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if a first-generation mother is a Dachshund 
                from the adoption center, their offspring’s dominant body-part genes will be 
                made up completely of Dachshund body parts, from head to toe, no 
                matter the breed of the father. Likewise, the offspring’s recessive 
                gene pool will be made up completely of the first-generation father’s 
                body parts. Also keep in mind that because second-generation offspring 
                can’t carry recessive marking or color mutations, their recessive 
                markings and colors will match their father’s, as well. However,
                the dominant marking and color genes can mutate, despite the mother's genes.
            </p>
            <p>
                When beginning a breeding project with a specific body part combination in 
                mind, consider which mother and father — which breeds — would be most beneficial 
                to the project, and which breed should make up most dominant body parts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember, second-generation offspring who visibly exhibit a unique combination 
                of body parts cannot carry that genetic profile and will never pass down that 
                combination to third-generation offspring, except by mutation. Body-part genes 
                do not shuffle until the third generation, so don’t waste time breeding a 
                specific combination of uninheritable exhibited features.

            <p>
                Second-generation offspring have the potential to save or sabotage any breeding project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since second-generation marking factor, coat color, eyelid color, and eye color mutations are always dominant, 
                second-generation offspring boast strong genes which may possibly both pass down and 
                be exhibited in third-generation offspring, setting the very foundation for every breeding project.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, it’s important to remember that the appearance of second-generation offspring 
                cannot always be trusted — only their genetic profile is the source of truth. No matter 
                the appearance of offspring — marking factor, coat color, eyelid color, eye color — the rules 
                above will always apply. Most important, do not be fooled by body parts of second-generation 
                mixed breeds. Body-part genes do not take affect until the third generation, which will be 
                discussed in the next chapter, so don’t waste time breeding second-generation offspring 
                for a specific arrangement body parts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before moving forward with any breeding project, it’s critical to first check the genes of 
                potential second-generation parents or risk polluting the gene pool with undesirable 
                genes right from the start. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For best results and ideal third-generation gene profiles, it’s best to breed two second-generation 
                offspring who share desired genes. By breeding second-generation parents with shared desired genetics 
                together, their third-generation offspring has the potential to inherit both parents’ genes, which may 
                fall into both the offspring’s dominant and recessive gene pools. This technique can boost any breeding 
                project, as the genetic advantage gives third-generation parents the most potential to impact the future
                health and success of the project.

                First-generation Mutt parents only pass down the patches and ears they exhibit. 
                While the patches and ears may mutate in second-generation offspring, the offspring can 
                only exhibit less patches and ears than their parents, never more and never new. 
                When breeding Mutts, it’s important the parents exhibit the patches desired in 
                offspring, or they will be need to be bred into the line at a later date, which 
                could damage the integrity of the breeding project.
